  SD1_1:
    description: "Counts physical or visual objects by ones"

# Define basic evidence types we might look for (simplified)

  ANSWER_TYPED: "Student typed an answer text"

# Define probes associated with certain conditions (very simple logic placeholder)
probes:
  - id: P1_HOW_SOLVE
    text: "Tell me how you figured that out."
    speak: true
    trigger_condition: # When to ask this probe
      requires_evidence: ["DRAW_ANY"] # Ask if student drew *anything*

# Define how assessment stops (simplified)
stop_conditions:
  - id: SC1_ANSWERED
    requires_evidence: ["ANSWER_TYPED"] # Stop if student types *anything*

# Placeholder for assigning level (will be more complex later)
level_assignment:
  - level: SD1_1 # Assign this level...
    requires_evidence: ["DRAW_ANY", "ANSWER_TYPED"] # ...if they drew and typed something
